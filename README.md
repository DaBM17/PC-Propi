# PC-Propi

This project consists in a demo of a typical web commerce site for buying computer components. It was the main project of the introductory course in web technologies at my third year in college. Sadly, since it relied on a university server where the database was located and that server was closed after the end of the course we can no longer execute the PHP code needed for the web to work.

## Characteristics

- Built using the MVC model
- You can sign-up and login with user credentials
- Can simulate the process of adding products to a shopping cart and buying them
- The database is PostgreSQL one

## Languages used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
